# Flutter Simple Beat Maker

This is a very simple onboarding project for flutter. It covers a couple of basic features
available using the Flutter SDK.

## Getting Started

I suggest starting with a default Flutter project and try to follow each commit pushed to the repo.
[See commits history](https://github.com/JustAnotherCharlie/FlutterSimpleBeatMaker/commits/master)

For this project the SDK used was version 2_10_5 and can be downloaded from the official [Flutter
releases page](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases). 

## Small Extra Training

Clone the repository to your machine and try running the project. If you have dependency issues
try using the version 2_10_5 of the Flutter SDK.

Once you the project running properly try the following changes:

- Update the playing button to use the Play and Pause assets available within the project instead
of showing a text with the beat status.
  
- Add some sort of loop position indicator so the user can know in which part of the loop the beat
is currently at. 
  
- Add a volume slider to each audio controller and allow the user to update the volume of each
controller.
